# Mandala Art using Python Turtle Graphics
Hi, there! Mandala art is known for its spiritual symbolism in Asian cultures, particularly Buddhism. It is a creation wherein patterns are formed and related to meditation. In this case, I had difficulty choosing what particular design to take reference because I like everything! Until I saw a picture of a lotus while I was scrolling. So, I decided to make a mandala art in a likeness of a lotus. I used the colors blue and green to make the water and leaf "concept." I chose yellow for the central piece instead of the usual pink or blue because of the warmth and sunniness it brings to me. I want those who see the art to be gradually entranced to relaxation by the white circular patterns and to be uplifted by the dainty yellow flower in the middle.
